This is a flight simulator, written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, which is controlled by a bluetooth haptic glove that I built.

It handles the discovery and connection to the bluetooth microcontroller on the glove, and transforms received signals into changes in throttle level, angles, and braking.

The simulator also has built-in safety features to stop the user from crashing into the ground, and has convenience features such as auto-land, auto-home, and auto-stop features.
